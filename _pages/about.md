Hey, I'm Ada!

I like a lot of things! Right now, I'm interested in software engineering, security, and education.

I work as a software engineer in Google's [global networking](https://research.google/teams/global-networking/) team.

Before that, I studied computer science and law at UNSW, then decided to graduate with just the computer science degree and run with it.

I've been lucky enough to work with some fantastic people and groups over the years, including the Open Source Security Team at Google Sydney, the staff at non-profit [Gradient Institute](https://gradientinstitute.org/), and the teaching team at the [UNSW School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering/our-schools/computer-science-and-engineering).


Welcome to my corner of the internet!
