Hey, I'm Ada!

I like a lot of things. At the moment, I'm wandering around tech with interests in software engineering, information security, and education.

I studied computer science and law at UNSW Sydney before deciding to graduate with just the computer science degree and run with it.

I've been lucky enough to work with some fantastic people and groups over the years, including the Open Source Security Team at Google Sydney, the staff at non-profit [Gradient Institute](https://gradientinstitute.org/), and the teaching team at the [UNSW School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering/our-schools/computer-science-and-engineering).

Before that, I met a bunch of cool peeps through [SecSoc](https://unswsecurity.com), [GPN](https://www.girlsprogramming.network/), and [NCSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Computer_Science_School).

Welcome to my corner of the internet!
