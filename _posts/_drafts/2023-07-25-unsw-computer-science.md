description: A blog post in the works... email me questions!

I'm writing a blog post about studying computer science at UNSW!

The target audience for this post will be high school students deciding what to do at university.

I'm hoping to collate my perspective on some frequently asked questions, including:

* Why I chose computer science (and why I think it's super cool)
* Computer Science vs Software Engineering
* Making friends within CSE (aka Student Societies 101)
* Degree Pre-Requisites / ATARs / HSC Subjects
* Doing CS with zero prior programming experience
* What you can do with a CS degree

... aaaand anything else you want to ask!

If you have questions or topics you'd like me to cover (including topics already listed above), please email me at [adaluong@protonmail.com](mailto:adaluong@protonmail.com).

It would be really good if you could include a short intro about who you are - are you a high school student? definitely considering studying comp sci or just curious? how did you find this page?

I'm aiming to publish the post here in September-ish. 

For now, you might be interested in reading [CSESoc's guides](https://media.csesoc.org.au/tag/guides/) or [my article on how double degrees work](https://adaluong.me/blog/double-degrees/).
